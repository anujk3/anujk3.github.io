Title: About Me
Slug: about-me
Authors: Anuj Katiyal

Welcome to Solarized Mode ON. I created this website to share my everyday
learnings in the field of Data Science and blog about them. I hope that the
issues I face would help other people to learn and it might be easier for them
as a reference to some common issues faced by Data Scientists.

Many concepts and tools that the data scientists, engineers and technologists
use have a steep learning curve, and I hope to make some of those easier to
understand for anyone interested. Technology has allowed me to appreciate
things in the world that I would have never dreamed of, and this site is a
journey of my learning new technologies to help me better understand the
world we live in, from a Data Scientist's perspective.

I have been fortunate to be a very curious person, and I enjoy wearing many
hats. Professionally, I consider myself a Data Scientist who also enjoys
software development and is intrigued by the advances in web and mobile app
development. My hobbies include reading data science blogs, running, cycling,
swimming, watching soccer (FCBarcelona fan). I have been a linux and OSX user
and passionate about the open-source world because I do feel that open source
contributions to libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, PyTorch have helped
advance the field of Data Science which I can relate to with a sense of
belongingness.

Through this blog, I hope to share some of my frustrations in the world of
 technology, and maybe beyond. I also find that slowing down every day and
 just writing, something, helps me channel my thoughts and motivations, and I
 think this will be an excellent chance to help me to keep writing.
So, I hope to be of help to other through tutorials of handy tools and
libraries I use on a daily basis, as well as share my adventure in the world
data science, engineering, math, programming, linux, open-source things, and
 whatever else I find interesting.

Thanks for reading!
